# Railways and the Happy Danes

.pull-left[
### Motivaiton
- It is reasonable to suppose that there is interplay between institutions, human capital, culture and geography (market access)
- **Hypothesis:** Danish railways brought Grudtvigianism - socalled 'happy' Danes

### This talk 
- Very preliminary - mostly speculative 
- Brief historical background
- Some preliminary results and ideas for identification

# Origin

- Paul supervised Magnus masters Thesis, which replicated .red[Berger, 2019] in Denmark 
- Tom started studying the influence of railways on human capital and social mobility 
- I've been interested in railways ever since I wrote my Bachelor thesis on it 
- Rough draft of the synergy of all these ideas: **Railways and the Happy Danes**
- Seemingly the first ever EH paper on Danish railways

- Difference in difference
- **Identifying assumption:**
  + Places with railways would have had a paralel developmental path given the absence of railways
- **Threats:**
  + Selection: Places on a prosperous path might be selected into connection. Or the opposite - deliberate investments targeted at growth.

### Instrument
- The task of the first stage is to predict well (Mullainathan & Spiess, 2017)
- Classical approach: Linear trunk-lines
- But we can do much better
- Turns out that the terrain mattered even in one of Europe's flattes countries
- 

I think I have figured out how to set up the cost function for the LCP's. According to Herzog (2013) an appropriate cost function for wheeled vehicles is: cost(s) = 1 + (s/S)^2 where s is the percent slope and S is a critical slope parameter (also % slope) which "typically" is in the range of 8-16.
